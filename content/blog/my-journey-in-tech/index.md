My journey in tech began with a strong foundation in mathematics, which I've leveraged to solve complex problems across various industries, from fintech and SaaS to automotive and digital consultancy. Throughout my career, I have consistently delivered innovative solutions that balance technical excellence with business value.

My recent work includes leading the migration of critical platforms to cloud-native architectures, reducing downtime by 35% and improving operational efficiency through automation. I thrive in dynamic environments where I can combine hands-on engineering with strategic thinking to build robust systems that scale.

I am particularly passionate about challenges that require integrating emerging technologies like Kubernetes and AI into existing ecosystems while maintaining reliability and security. My certifications in Kubernetes (CKAD, CKA) and hands-on experience with AWS, Docker, and microservices architectures position me well to tackle complex technical problems.

I look forward to sharing insights on designing scalable systems, leading technical initiatives, and driving continuous improvement on this blog.
