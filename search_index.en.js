仅通过清晰的结构化文档，就能生成整个系统的代码、测试与部署脚本。\n而这个梦想，正在「语义驱动开发」的浪潮下成真。\n本文是该系列的第一篇，我们将深入介绍什么是 MiniSpec DSL，以及它背后的 SACC 五层语义模型，如何重构我们对工程语言、上下文与 AI 的理解方式。\n\n软件工程师的终极梦想：从 UML 到 AI-native DSL🔗\n在过去数十年中，UML 曾被视为实现自动化开发的希望：以图形化的方式描述系统设计，理论上可以生成代码。但最终它在工程实践中失败了。\n为什么？\n\n语义模糊，图像与代码不一致\n缺乏语法约束，难以维护\n不利于版本控制与协作\n\n如今，随着 AI 大模型的出现，「Prompt Engineering」再度点燃了自动化生成的希望。然而，它同样面临：\n\n无结构、不可控\n幻觉、错误率高\n不易团队共建\n\n这两者的教训是明确的：我们需要一种新的语言层，来清晰描述工程意图与上下文。\n这就是 MiniSpec DSL 的诞生背景。\n\nMiniSpec 是什么？🔗\nMiniSpec（Minimal Specification）是一种语义驱动开发语法，旨在让工程意图可以被 AI 与人类共同理解并映射为可执行产物。\n它不取代编程语言，而是站在编程语言之上，提供一种统一、清晰、可生成的语义描述。\n其设计原则包括：\n准则描述\n✅ 可读性人类工程师能轻松理解\n✅ 可结构化JSON/YAML 表达，方便 LLM parsing\n✅ 上下文与意图分离context 与 spec 分开，清楚界定语义边界\n✅ 可映射到行动每个 spec 都可映射为一个 agent 任务\n✅ 模块化适合各种场景：test、infra、deploy、api doc、prompt\n\n\nMiniSpec 语法示例🔗\n\n\n对应应用输出🔗\n类型LLM 可生成\n✅ 测试码RSpec / Jest / Pytest\n✅ Infra CodeTerraform / Pulumi\n✅ API 文档Swagger / OpenAPI\n✅ PromptFunction schema / Assistant\n✅ DevOpsGitHub Action / CI pipeline\n✅ 文档README.md / Spec文档\n✅ UI 输出Figma DSL / HTML prototype\n✅ scaffoldingmodel/controller/service\n\n\nSACC 五层语义模型🔗\n基于对 AI 与代码交互的深入理解，我们提出了 SACC（Spec and Context as Code）五层模型：\n层级架构🔗\n层级名称功能定位类比\nL1Symbolic Layer最底层：语言符号、token、位元流类似 OSI 的物理层/数据层\nL2Instruction Layer基本语法 + API 调用 + 控制结构（如 if/else、function）类似 OSI 的网络/传输层\nL3Intent Layer用户的明确意图，如「为这段程序代码写测试」类似 OSI 的会话层\nL4Context Layer任务背景、对话历史、角色设定、先前知识类似 OSI 的展示层\nL5Specification Layer任务标准、业务规格、约束条件、meta-goals类似 OSI 的应用层\n\n每层的具体解析🔗\nL1. Symbolic Layer — LLM 接收与处理的语言原子\n\n所有语言处理都是从符号开始：token、字符、字符串、操作码\n对应：Tokenizer, Embeddings, Binary Instructions, Assembly\n示例：字符串 \"def\"、token ##ing，或嵌入向量 [0.82, -0.12, ...]\n\nL2. Instruction Layer — 程序行为的语法结构\n\n函数、条件语句、API 调用，是执行层级的基本单位\nAI 对这层的理解是行为模拟的关键（像 Copilot 那样补 code）\n示例：for, return, fetch('/api'), assert, 等语法节点\n\nL3.

But it ultimately failed in engineering practice.\nWhy?\n\nSemantic ambiguity, inconsistency between diagrams and code\nLack of syntactic constraints, difficult to maintain\nPoor for version control and collaboration\n\nNow, with the emergence of AI large models, \"Prompt Engineering\" has reignited hope for automated generation. However, it faces similar challenges:\n\nUnstructured, uncontrollable\nHigh hallucination and error rates\nDifficult for team collaboration\n\nThe lessons from both are clear: we need a new language layer to clearly describe engineering intent and context.\nThis is the birth background of MiniSpec DSL.\n\nWhat is MiniSpec?🔗\nMiniSpec (Minimal Specification) is a semantic-driven development syntax designed to make engineering intent understandable by both AI and humans, and mappable to executable artifacts.\nIt doesn't replace programming languages, but stands above them, providing a unified, clear, and generatable semantic description.\nIts design principles include:\nPrincipleDescription\n✅ ReadabilityHuman engineers can easily understand\n✅ StructurabilityJSON/YAML expression, convenient for LLM parsing\n✅ Context-Intent SeparationSeparate context from spec, clearly defining semantic boundaries\n✅ Action MappableEach spec can be mapped to an agent task\n✅ ModularitySuitable for various scenarios: test, infra, deploy, api doc, prompt\n\n\nMiniSpec Syntax Example🔗\n\n\nCorresponding Application Outputs🔗\nTypeLLM Can Generate\n✅ Test CodeRSpec / Jest / Pytest\n✅ Infra CodeTerraform / Pulumi\n✅ API DocumentationSwagger / OpenAPI\n✅ PromptFunction schema / Assistant\n✅ DevOpsGitHub Action / CI pipeline\n✅ DocumentationREADME.md / Spec docs\n✅ UI OutputFigma DSL / HTML prototype\n✅ Scaffoldingmodel/controller/service\n\n\nThe SACC Five-Layer Semantic Model🔗\nBased on deep understanding of AI-code interaction, we propose the SACC (Spec and Context as Code) five-layer model:\nLayer Architecture🔗\nLayerNameFunctionAnalogy\nL1Symbolic LayerBottom layer: language symbols, tokens, bitstreamsSimilar to OSI physical/data layer\nL2Instruction LayerBasic syntax + API calls + control structures (like if/else, function)Similar to OSI network/transport layer\nL3Intent LayerUser's explicit intent, like \"write tests for this code\"Similar to OSI session layer\nL4Context LayerTask background, conversation history, role settings, prior knowledgeSimilar to OSI presentation layer\nL5Specification LayerTask standards, business specifications, constraints, meta-goalsSimilar to OSI application layer\n\nDetailed Analysis of Each Layer🔗\nL1. Symbolic Layer — Language atoms received and processed by LLM\n\nAll language processing starts from symbols: tokens, characters, strings, opcodes\nCorresponds to: Tokenizer, Embeddings, Binary Instructions, Assembly\nExamples: string \"def\", token ##ing, or embedding vectors [0.82, -0.12, ...]\n\nL2. Instruction Layer — Syntactic structure of program behavior\n\nFunctions, conditional statements, API calls are the basic units at the execution level\nAI's understanding of this layer is key to behavior simulation (like Copilot's code completion)\nExamples: for, return, fetch('/api'), assert, and other syntax nodes\n\nL3. Intent Layer — Human's specific intent of \"what to do\"\n\nThis is the core level of prompt, e.g.: \"Please automatically generate test code for this API\"\nLLM plans program output based on intent\nSimilar to function \"calls\" but more semantic and fuzzy\n\nL4. Context Layer — The source of AI understanding where context is king\n\nThis layer is LLM's \"short-term memory\" and \"contextual understanding\"\nIncludes previous conversation content, role assumptions, input methods, prompt history\nWithout context, AI is prone to hallucination or task misunderstanding\n\n✅ At this layer, we first propose: Spec/Context as Code\nSpec/Context determines behavior, just as Code determines output.\nL5. Specification Layer — Meta-instruction layer of semantics and logic\n\nLike software specifications, describing \"what should be accomplished\" and its boundaries\nMay come from: Product spec, Swagger, User story, design diagrams\nThis layer doesn't directly appear in input but determines whether final output is correct\n\n\nWhy Do We Need Such a Model?🔗\n✅ 1. Clearly Divide AI's Task \"Thinking Levels\"🔗\n\nAI's understanding of prompts isn't simple text matching, but crosses semantic structures\nEstablishing this layering helps build more stable, controllable AI behavior models\n\n✅ 2. Help Us Design More Precise Prompt Flow🔗\n\nYou can adjust prompt tone and command structure at the Intent layer\nDesign input flow and context control strategies at the Context layer\nUse DSL (like JSON schema) at the Specification layer to clearly limit generation behavior\n\n✅ 3. Make AI \"Programmable\", Not Just Vague Dialogue🔗\n\nTreating context as program code (Spec/Context as Code), we can:\nVersion control context\nUnit test differences in output from different contexts\nForm \"context script libraries\": every prompt context is a reusable logic module\n\n\nDifferences Between MiniSpec and Prompt Engineering🔗\nDimensionPrompt EngineeringMiniSpec DSL\nReproducibility❌ Poor, slight input change completely different output✅ High, controllable output\nTestability❌ Difficult to write unit tests✅ Can generate test cases\nTeam Consensus❌ Relies on individual skills✅ DSL + Schema\nMulti-module Collaboration❌ Difficult to integrate with CI/CD✅ Can integrate with GitHub Workflow\nMulti-scenario Extension⚠️ Requires lots of prompt writing✅ Naturally extends to Infra / UI / API Doc etc.\n\n\nVision: Building AI-native Engineering Ecosystem🔗\nOur goal isn't just MiniSpec, but an entire semantic-driven development ecosystem:\n\n✅ MiniSpec DSL and Playground\n✅ VSCode Extension and GitHub Workflow integration\n✅ DevOps + OpenAPI + Prompt multi-scenario support\n✅ Open specifications + 100 tutorial articles\n\nWe call it: SACC (Spec and Context as Code)\n\nConclusion: The Beginning of an Era🔗\nThis isn't \"just another YAML DSL,\" but an upgrade in cognitive approach.\nThe essence of engineering is semantic alignment.\nWhat we aim to do is provide a language that's both human-writable and AI-understandable, letting semantics no longer hide behind code, but become the first layer driving everything.\nThis is Semantic-Driven Development (Semantic-first Engineering).\n\nThis is the first article in the SACC series, with subsequent articles diving deep into various practices and application scenarios of semantic-driven development.\n","id":"https://williamhatch.github.io/william_blog/blog/001-semantic-driven-engineering/","title":"Semantic-Driven Software Engineering: MiniSpec and the SACC Five-Layer Model"},"https://williamhatch.github.io/william_blog/blog/ai-coding-best-practices-zh/":{"body":"\n\"编程的未来不是取代开发者，而是增强他们的能力。关键在于建立一个框架，让人类保持控制权的同时充分利用AI的优势。\"\n\nGitHub Copilot和ChatGPT等AI编程助手的崛起在开发社区引发了既兴奋又担忧的讨论。虽然这些工具能显著加快编码速度，但如果没有结构化的使用方法，可能导致架构混乱、代码质量不一致，以及项目控制权的丧失。\n本文提出了一个系统化的人机协作框架，确保你在最大化利用AI潜力的同时保持对架构的控制。\n框架概览🔗\n\n挑战：为什么AI编程需要结构化方法🔗\n不受控制的AI编程助手常常导致以下问题：\n\n偏离业务目标：AI可能过度优化代码优雅性而忽视业务需求\n架构不一致：生成的代码可能与项目规范不符\n测试覆盖不足：关键边界情况和错误处理常被忽略\n失去控制权：人机责任边界模糊不清\n代码膨胀：生成大量冗余或不必要的代码，增加复杂度却没有实际价值\n代码退化：可能导致原本良好的代码被破坏或意外删除\n\n这些挑战凸显了在AI辅助开发中采用结构化方法的必要性。\n受控的AI协作框架🔗\n让我们探索一个能解决这些挑战同时最大化AI优势的结构化方法。\n1. 测试驱动开发（TDD）优先🔗\n在实现之前先写测试。这种方法：\n\n为你和AI明确需求\n确保可验证的结果\n保持对业务逻辑的关注\n\nAI提示示例：\n\n2.

Open source projects can sometimes be very large and complex, so having techniques to navigate and understand them is essential. While many articles on this topic exist on platforms like Juejin, this series aims to share some of my own experiences to help you get started. This first article introduces ERD (Entity Relationship Diagram) tools.\n\nWhat is an ER Model?🔗\nThe ER (Entity Relationship) model is usually the output of system analysis used to define and describe the key content within the business domain. It does not define business processes but presents business data patterns in a graphical form.\n\nTypically, the ER model consists of entities (represented by boxes) connected by relationships (lines), where the lines represent associations and dependencies between entities. For example, a building can have zero or more apartments, but an apartment belongs to exactly one building.\nEntities can be characterized by relationships as well as additional attributes, including identifiers called primary keys. A diagram showing entities, their attributes, and relationships is called an entity-attribute-relationship diagram (ERD).\nIn practice, ER models are implemented as databases. In a simple relational database, each row represents an instance of an entity type, each column is an attribute, and relationships between entities are implemented via foreign keys.\n\nHow ERD Helps in Reading Open Source Projects🔗\nERDs visually represent the data structures and relationships, helping you quickly grasp the backbone of complex systems. This is especially helpful when facing large open source codebases — ERDs highlight the core data models and how they interact, speeding up comprehension.\n\n\nExample: Generating ERD for Spree E-commerce🔗\nSpree is a popular open-source e-commerce platform similar to Shopify. Let's use it as an example to generate an ERD.\n\nOn macOS, install Graphviz:\n\nConfigure your database in config/database.yaml and create the database, then run migrations:\n\nGenerate the ERD:\n\nYou will get a simple diagram showing main entities and their relationships.\n\n\nImproving ERD with Color🔗\nThe default ERD can be hard to read with many entities connected together. To improve clarity, change the rails-erd gem source in your Gemfile to a version that supports colors:\n\nThen update bundles and regenerate:\n\nThe color-coded ERD improves readability by visually distinguishing different modules and their relationships.\n\n\nNext Steps and Future Plans🔗\n\nDefine entities and their relationships in YAML format, then automatically generate Rails models and colored ERDs.\nCreate a web-based drag-and-drop UI (inspired by Strapi admin dashboard) for easier YAML and ERD generation.\nDevelop a Nuxt3-based UI to select and generate ERDs only for related modules, making diagrams more focused.\n\nThe ultimate goal is to enable drag-and-drop modeling that automatically generates RESTful and GraphQL APIs, supports authentication and logging, and follows Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principles in the backend.\n\nReferences and Resources🔗\n\nrails-erd GitHub repository\nSpree Starter GitHub repository\nOriginal article in Chinese on Juejin: How to Better Read Open Source Software Part 1 (掘金)\n\n\nThanks for reading!

DeepWiki🔗\nA case study on reimagining Crawlee-Python in Ruby using AI-powered documentation tools\nIntroduction🔗\nAfter two decades of contributing to open source projects, I've learned that the biggest barrier to meaningful contribution isn't technical complexity—it's cognitive overhead. Understanding large, unfamiliar codebases remains one of the most challenging aspects of open source development. Traditional approaches to code exploration are time-consuming and often leave developers feeling overwhelmed before they even begin.\nThis changed fundamentally when I discovered DeepWiki, an AI-powered documentation platform that transforms how we navigate and understand complex codebases. In this case study, I'll walk you through how I used DeepWiki to deconstruct Crawlee-Python—one of the most elegant web crawling libraries I've encountered—and subsequently reimagined it in Ruby, creating crawlee-ruby.\nThis isn't just about porting code from Python to Ruby. It's about leveraging modern AI tools to accelerate open source understanding and contribution in ways that were unimaginable just a few years ago.\nThe Challenge: Understanding Crawlee-Python🔗\nCrawlee-Python, developed by Apify, represents sophisticated engineering: a modular, extensible web crawling framework that handles everything from request queuing to data storage with remarkable elegance. However, like most well-architected projects, its sophistication comes with complexity.\nThe codebase spans multiple domains:\n\nRequest Management: Queue processing, retry logic, rate limiting\nBrowser Automation: Playwright and Selenium integration\nData Pipeline: Storage abstractions, dataset management\nConcurrency: Async/await patterns, worker pools\nConfiguration: Flexible plugin architecture\n\nFor a newcomer, understanding how these components interact—and more importantly, why they were designed this way—requires significant investment. This is where DeepWiki fundamentally changes the game.\nDeepWiki: X-Ray Vision for Code🔗\nWhat Makes DeepWiki Different🔗\nDeepWiki isn't just another documentation generator. It's an AI-powered code intelligence platform that creates structural understanding from source code. Here's what sets it apart:\n🔍 Automatic Architecture Discovery\n\nGenerates dependency graphs and call hierarchies\nIdentifies core modules and their relationships\nMaps data flow between components\n\n🧠 AI-Enhanced Documentation\n\nAuto-generates summaries for classes and methods\nProvides semantic search across the entire codebase\nOffers contextual explanations for complex logic\n\n📊 Visual Code Maps\n\nCreates entity-relationship diagrams\nShows inheritance hierarchies\nVisualizes module dependencies\n\n🔧 Developer-Friendly Interface\n\nOne-click navigation between related components\nInline annotations and cross-references\nVersion comparison and change tracking\n\nGetting Started with DeepWiki🔗\nThe setup process is remarkably simple:\n\nNavigate to DeepWiki\nReplace github.com with deepwiki.com in any GitHub URL\n\nExample: https://github.com/apify/crawlee-python → https://deepwiki.com/apify/crawlee-python\n\n\nFor first-time indexing: Provide your email address\nWait for indexing notification (typically 5-15 minutes)\n\nThat's it. No configuration, no setup scripts, no API keys. DeepWiki handles the heavy lifting of code analysis and documentation generation.\nCase Study: Deconstructing Crawlee-Python🔗\nInitial Exploration🔗\nWhen I first navigated to https://deepwiki.com/apify/crawlee-python, I was presented with a comprehensive overview that would have taken hours to compile manually:\nCore Architecture Overview\n\nKey Components Identified\n\nBasicCrawler: The orchestration layer\nRequestQueue: Manages crawling queue with persistence\nRouterHandler: Maps URL patterns to processing logic\nStorageInterface: Abstracts data persistence\nContextManager: Provides request context to handlers\n\nDeep Dive into Request Management🔗\nUsing DeepWiki's semantic search, I searched for \"request queue management\" and immediately found the core logic in _autoscaled_pool.py. The AI summary revealed:\n\n\"Implements adaptive concurrency control with configurable scaling factors. Monitors response times and error rates to automatically adjust worker pool size, ensuring optimal resource utilization while respecting rate limits.\"\n\nThis single summary provided insight that would have required reading hundreds of lines of code and understanding the broader context of how Crawlee balances performance with politeness.\nUnderstanding the Handler System🔗\nThe router implementation showcased Crawlee's elegance:\n\nDeepWiki's call graph showed how handlers are resolved, registered, and executed, making it clear how the library achieves its clean, declarative API while maintaining flexibility.\nReimagining in Ruby: The Port Process🔗\nWhy Ruby?🔗\nRuby's expressive syntax and strong metaprogramming capabilities made it an ideal candidate for reimagining Crawlee's interface. Where Python uses explicit configuration, Ruby could leverage blocks and DSLs to create even more intuitive APIs.\nArchitecture Decisions🔗\nArmed with DeepWiki's insights into Crawlee-Python's design decisions, I could make informed choices about what to preserve and what to adapt:\n✅ Preserved from Python\n\nModular storage interface\nRequest queue persistence strategy\nHandler router pattern\nContext object design\n\n🔄 Adapted for Ruby\n\nBlock-based handler DSL\nRack-inspired middleware pattern\nActiveRecord-style configuration\nRuby-native error handling\n\nThe Ruby Implementation🔗\nHere's how Crawlee-Ruby's interface evolved:\n\nThe Ruby version maintains Crawlee's power while feeling native to Ruby developers familiar with Rails and Sinatra patterns.\nUsing DeepWiki for Documentation🔗\nAuto-Generated Documentation🔗\nOnce crawlee-ruby was indexed in DeepWiki, the platform automatically generated:\n📚 Component Documentation\n\nClass and method signatures with inferred descriptions\nUsage examples extracted from tests\nCross-references to related components\n\n🗺️ Architecture Diagrams\n\nModule dependency graphs\nClass inheritance hierarchies\nData flow visualizations\n\n🔍 Searchable Interface\n\nFull-text search across all components\nSemantic search for concept-based queries\nCross-language comparison with original Python version\n\nValidation and Refinement🔗\nDeepWiki's analysis helped identify areas for improvement:\n\nComplexity hotspots: Methods with high cyclomatic complexity\nDependency concerns: Circular dependencies between modules\nDocumentation gaps: Classes lacking clear descriptions\n\nThis feedback guided refactoring decisions and ensured the Ruby port maintained the architectural clarity of the original.\nThe AI-Accelerated Development Process🔗\nPrompt-Driven Development🔗\nMy development process evolved to leverage AI at every stage:\n\nAnalysis Phase: Use DeepWiki to understand target functionality\nPlanning Phase: Generate implementation TODOs with AI assistance\nImplementation Phase: TDD with AI-generated test cases\nDocumentation Phase: Auto-generate docs via DeepWiki\nRefinement Phase: Iterate based on AI feedback\n\nExample: Implementing the Router🔗\nAI-Generated TODO List:\n\nThis structured approach eliminated the typical back-and-forth of figuring out implementation details, allowing me to focus on design decisions and Ruby-specific optimizations.\nResults and Impact🔗\nDevelopment Velocity🔗\nThe combination of DeepWiki for understanding and AI for implementation resulted in:\n\n10x faster comprehension of the original codebase\n5x faster implementation of equivalent functionality\nHigher quality documentation from day one\nMore comprehensive test coverage through AI-generated test cases\n\nCode Quality🔗\nThe Ruby port achieved:\n\nClean, idiomatic Ruby code that feels native to Ruby developers\nComprehensive test suite with high coverage\nClear architectural boundaries informed by DeepWiki analysis\nExtensible design that maintains Crawlee's flexibility\n\nImplications for Open Source🔗\nLowering Contribution Barriers🔗\nTools like DeepWiki democratize open source contribution by:\n\nReducing cognitive load for newcomers\nAccelerating understanding of complex architectures\nEnabling cross-language learning and adaptation\nFacilitating knowledge transfer between projects\n\nRethinking Documentation🔗\nTraditional documentation often becomes outdated quickly. AI-generated documentation:\n\nStays current with code changes\nProvides multiple perspectives on the same functionality\nScales automatically with project growth\nAdapts to different user needs (beginner vs. expert)\n\nThe Future of Code Exploration🔗\nWe're witnessing a fundamental shift in how developers interact with code:\n\nFrom linear reading to spatial navigation\nFrom manual analysis to AI-assisted understanding\nFrom isolated learning to collaborative intelligence\nFrom static documentation to dynamic exploration\n\nPractical Recommendations🔗\nFor Open Source Maintainers🔗\n\nIndex your projects in DeepWiki to provide enhanced exploration\nUse AI-generated summaries to identify documentation gaps\nLeverage architecture diagrams for onboarding new contributors\nMonitor usage patterns to understand how developers navigate your code\n\nFor Contributors🔗\n\nStart with DeepWiki before diving into code\nUse semantic search to find relevant components quickly\nStudy architecture diagrams to understand system boundaries\nCompare with similar projects to understand design choices\n\nFor Organizations🔗\n\nStandardize on AI documentation tools for internal projects\nTrain developers on efficient code exploration techniques\nEstablish contribution guidelines that leverage modern tooling\nMeasure and optimize developer onboarding processes\n\nLooking Forward🔗\nThe crawlee-ruby project represents more than just a successful port—it's a proof of concept for AI-accelerated open source development. As these tools mature, we can expect:\n\nFaster innovation cycles through improved knowledge transfer\nHigher quality contributions from better-informed developers\nMore diverse participation as barriers to entry decrease\nStronger open source ecosystems built on shared understanding\n\nConclusion🔗\nThe combination of DeepWiki's code intelligence and AI-assisted development has fundamentally changed how I approach open source projects. What once required weeks of exploration and months of implementation can now be accomplished in days while maintaining—or even improving—code quality.\nThe crawlee-ruby project stands as testament to this new paradigm: a complete reimagining of a sophisticated Python library, created in a fraction of the time traditionally required, with comprehensive documentation and test coverage from day one.\nThis is just the beginning. As AI tools continue to evolve, the boundary between understanding and contributing to open source software will continue to blur, creating opportunities for more developers to participate in the projects that power our digital infrastructure.\n\nResources🔗\n\n🚀 Crawlee-Ruby: github.com/williamhatch/crawlee-ruby\n📚 DeepWiki Documentation: deepwiki.com/williamhatch/crawlee-ruby\n🐍 Original Crawlee-Python: github.com/apify/crawlee-python\n🧠 DeepWiki Platform: deepwiki.com\n\n\nThis article is part of a series on modern open source development practices.

Pages上。但我决定给这个计划增加一点新花样。我不想独自完成。我决定几乎完全与一个AI结对程序员——Cursor——合作来完成，看看我们距离黄仁勋所描绘的愿景到底有多近。\n这篇文章就是那段旅程的故事。它不是一个所有步骤都完美无缺、经过消毒的教程。它是一个关于人与机器协作的、真实的、未加修饰的记录。这是一个关于胜利、意外弯路、调试地狱，以及最终，关于一种全新的、强大的软件构建方式的故事。\n第一章：奠定基石🔗\n每个项目都始于一条命令。对我来说，是 zola init william_blog。但从那一刻起，我希望让AI来主导。\n我： \"好了，我已经启动了一个Zola项目。我想建一个简单的博客，然后部署到GitHub Pages。你能帮我设置好基本结构和GitHub Actions工作流吗？\"\nCursor (AI)： \"当然可以。\"\n它立刻开始构建项目。它创建了一个为Zola项目量身定制的 .gitignore 文件。然后，它在 .github/workflows/gh-pages.yml 中写下了我们CI/CD流水线的第一个版本。想法很简单：每当有代码推送到 main 分支，这个Action就会构建Zola站点，并将生成的静态文件部署到一个名为 gh-pages 的分支。\n这是对AI的第一次考验。它选择了一个名为 getzola/zola-action-build 的Action，看起来很合理。它还推荐了一个基础主题 deepthought。我接受了，AI便将其添加为Git子模块。\n骨架搭好了，是时候进行第一次提交了。以及，我们的第一个问题也随之而来。\ngit commit -m \"Initial commit with basic structure and theme\"\n命令失败了。Git抱怨说 themes/deepthought 目录是一个未初始化的Git仓库。这是一个经典的子模块问题。我把情况告诉了AI。\nCursor： \"我明白了。子模块已添加，但它自己的 .git 目录引发了冲突。我将删除该子模块的Git元数据，使其被当作一个普通目录来处理。\"\n它执行了 rm -rf themes/deepthought/.git。下一次提交顺利通过。我们上路了。我在GitHub上创建了一个新仓库，然后我们把代码推了上去。第一个Action开始运行。\n第二章：部署之舞🔗\n我盯着GitHub上我那次提交旁边的小黄点。它旋转着，然后变成了红色。失败。\n真正的合作从这里才开始。我不仅仅是下达指令，我还在为失败提供反馈。我点进日志，那是一堵即使是经验丰富的开发者也会感到畏惧的文本墙。错误信息很神秘：action not found。\n我把这个错误反馈给AI。\n我： \"GitHub Action失败了。错误是 action not found。\"\nCursor： \"我正在搜索关于这个错误的信息。看起来 getzola/zola-action-build 这个Action已经被弃用了。一个更现代且仍在维护的替代品是 shalzz/zola-deploy-action。我将更新工作流文件。\"\n只需几次敲击，它就重写了 gh-pages.yml 文件，用新的Action替换了旧的，并配置了必要的输入参数，比如要部署到的分支。我再次提交并推送。\n这一次，那个点变成了绿色。成功！\n我迫不及不及地在浏览器中输入我新博客的URL：https://williamhatch.github.io/william_blog/。\n迎接我的是一个纯白的页面，上面只有一条令人心碎的信息：404 Not Found。\n部署成功了，但页面却不存在。这是一个典型的GitHub Pages谜题。我向AI说明了情况。\nCursor： \"一次成功的部署却在GitHub Pages上出现404错误，通常指向仓库的设置问题。请确保GitHub Pages的源设置为'从分支部署'（Deploy from a branch），并且选择的分支是 gh-pages。\"\n我按照它的指示，在仓库设置中导航。情况果真如AI所料。源设置仍然是默认值，等待我告诉它去哪里找静态文件。我把它切换到 gh-pages 分支，保存，然后刷新了页面。\n成功了。一个基础的、没有样式的、写着\"Hello, World\"的页面出现了。我们上线了。\n第三章：改头换面🔗\ndeepthought 主题虽然能用，但我很快意识到它已经很旧并且无人维护了。我想要一些更现代、开箱即用功能更多的东西。经过一番搜索，我选择了 zolarwind。\n这意味着一次重大的改变。我不想只是简单地替换文件，我想用正确的方式来做。\n我： \"我决定换个主题。让我们移除 deepthought，然后把 zolarwind 作为一个真正的Git子模块加进来。然后，为了避免任何冲突，我们把之前创建的所有模板和内容都删掉，用新主题的结构重新开始。\"\n这种\"焦土\"策略是一次有计划的冒险。它比试图合并两个不同主题的结构要快得多。AI立刻理解了我的意图。它移除了旧的主题文件，执行了 git submodule add https://github.com/huhu/zolarwind.git themes/zolarwind，然后删除了我们之前创建的 templates、content 和其他目录，因为它知道这些都将从新主题中继承。\n第四章：定制主页🔗\n新主题就位后，是时候让它变得更\"我\"一些了。我不想在主页上展示标准的博客文章列表。我想要一个个人化的介绍。\n我向AI提供了我的个人简介和技能清单。我有一个设想：一个简洁、专业的头部，附有简短的个人介绍，下面是一个展示我技术技能的网格。我还想加点花样，要求在鼠标悬停在技能卡片上时，卡片会发光或变大，有一个微妙的动画效果。\nCursor： \"我将在根目录的 templates 文件夹下创建一个自定义的 index.html 来覆盖主题的默认设置。我将使用Tailwind CSS进行样式设计，并实现您要求的悬停动画。\"\n这是迄今为止最具创造性的任务，而它完成得非常漂亮。它编写了HTML结构，精心制作了布局所需的CSS类，并为悬停效果添加了必要的 transform 和 transition 属性。它甚至创建了一篇占位的博客文章，这样我们就有东西可以链接了。\n第五章：本地主机的迷宫🔗\n定制主页完成了。新主题也到位了。我兴奋地想看看这一切组合起来的样子。我运行了我期待已久的命令：zola serve。\n然后我进入了我只能称之为\"调试地狱\"的模式。\n错误： Template 'index.html' not found (模板 'index.html' 未找到)\n这太诡异了。文件明明就在那里。我告诉了AI。\nCursor： \"这很奇怪。因为您正在使用主题，可能需要在命令中指定它。试试 zola serve --theme zolarwind。\"\n错误： Found argument '--theme' which wasn't expected (发现了未预期的参数'--theme')\n什么？我检查了我的Zola版本：v0.20.0。根据文档，这个标志应该是存在的。我们俩都懵了。我们尝试了其他标志，比如 --root .。同样的错误。我们检查了shell别名，检查了Homebrew安装是否损坏。一切都说不通。感觉就像我的本地环境被下了咒。\n在十几次修复命令的尝试失败后，我们改变了策略。如果环境不肯屈服，那我们就让项目去适应它。\nCursor： \"看起来您本地的Zola安装行为异常。我提议一个替代方案：我们可以把 zolarwind 主题所有必要的文件（templates, static, i18n 等）直接复制到您项目的根目录。然后，我们在 config.toml 中注释掉 theme 设置。这将让Zola把它看作一个单一的、自包含的项目，从而绕过主题加载机制。\"\n这是个hack，但却是个聪明的hack。一个针对不合逻辑问题的务实解决方案。AI执行了复制操作，修改了配置文件，我再次运行了 zola serve。\n它工作了。本地服务器启动了。但我的宽慰是短暂的。控制台现在被新一波的错误淹没了。\n第六章：配置错误的连锁反应🔗\n我们的hack解决了一个问题，但却引发了一系列其他问题。zolarwind 主题，现在作为我们项目的核心，对 config.toml 文件有一些我们基础设置没有满足的特定期望。\n首先，一个关于缺少 tags 分类法的错误。AI添加了它。\n\n接下来，一个语法错误。AI最初把分类法放在一个 [taxonomies] 表里，但主题期望的是一个顶级的键。它纠正了自己。然后是关于缺少主题特定变量（如 path_language_resources）和菜单、社交链接数据结构不正确的错误。\n在将近一个小时的时间里，我们来来回回。我运行 zola serve，粘贴错误信息，AI就会分析它，查阅主题文档，然后提出对 config.toml 的修复方案。这是一个繁琐、艰苦的过程，如果独自一人会非常令人沮beta。但有了AI，这是一个快速的迭代循环：运行、失败、报告、修复、重复。\n最终，红色文本的洪流停止了。服务器在运行，没有任何错误。我在浏览器中打开 127.0.0.1:1111，它就在那里。我的定制主页，新主题，一切协同工作。太美了。\n第七章：最终Boss🔗\n本地开发终于搞定，我推送了所有更改。GitHub Action成功运行。绿色的对勾出现了。就是这次了。\n我访问了 https://williamhatch.github.io/william_blog/。\n页面加载了。HTML内容都在。我的简介，我的技能，博客文章的标题。但所有的样式都消失了。JavaScript坏了。图片不见了。这是一个贫瘠、无样式的烂摊子。\n我打开开发者控制台。那是一片404的海洋。浏览器试图加载 https://williamhatch.github.io/css/style.css，但它本应该寻找 https://williamhatch.github.io/william_blog/css/style.css。\n仓库的子路径 /william_blog/ 从每一个资源URL中都消失了。\n这是我的AI伙伴无法看到的问题，因为它只存在于GitHub Pages部署的上下文中。诊断它得靠我自己。我用 curl 确认了我的怀疑。问题很清楚：主题的模板正在使用硬编码的根相对路径（例如，href=\"/css/style.css\"）。\n我向AI解释了我的发现。这是我们的最终Boss。\n我： \"我找到问题了。生产环境的网站坏了，因为模板里所有的资源链接都是用斜杠开头的硬编码路径，比如 /css/main.css。当网站从一个子目录提供服务时，这行不通。我们需要把它们全部替换成Zola的 get_url() 函数来生成正确的、绝对的路径。\"\nCursor： \"完全明白。我将对所有相关的模板文件（base.html, header.html, list-element.html等）进行系统性的搜索和替换，将每一个资源URL都用 get_url() 包裹起来。\"\n它照做了。它一丝不苟地检查了每一个模板文件，找到了每一个 &lt;link&gt;、&lt;script&gt; 和 &lt;img&gt; 标签。它把 href=\"/css/generated.css\" 替换成 href=\"{{ get_url(path='css/generated.css') | safe }}\"。它找到了隐藏在partials甚至内联 style 属性中的路径。\n我推送了最后一批更改。Action运行。我屏住呼吸，刷新了页面。\n它就在那里。完美。样式加载了，悬停动画工作了，图片出现了。我的博客活了过来，功能齐全，并部署在互联网上，供所有人访问。\n结语：人机协同的新对话🔗\n回过头看，黄仁勋说对了吗？我，一个程序员，被淘汰了吗？没有。但我工作的性质改变了。它变得更少关乎单调的、逐行编写代码的苦差事，而更多地关乎高层次的指导、创造性的问题解决和精确的调试。\n这段旅程是一场对话。\n\n我说： \"给我建个博客。\"\nAI说： \"这是一个结构。哦，它失败了。\"\n我说： \"这是错误信息。它是什么意思？\"\nAI说： \"我研究了一下。这是修复方案。\"\n\n这种伙伴关系让我能够在一个更高的抽象层次上运作。我是架构师，而AI是那个速度极快、知识渊博、不知疲倦的施工队。它处理了样板代码，研究了晦涩的错误，并执行了繁琐的重构，让我得以解放出来，专注于更大的图景。\n我们还没到那个你可以说\"给我建个价值十亿美元的应用\"然后它就出现的阶段。但我们确实到了这样一个阶段：人与机器之间的对话可以创造出复杂的、功能性的、美观的软件。这门语言仍然由代码、提交和错误日志来断句，但它的语法正变得越来越人性化。而这，本身就是一个奇迹。\n你可以在这里访问最终建成的博客：https://williamhatch.github.io/william_blog/\n如果你好奇想看看我们这段旅程的完整提交历史，代码在GitHub上是开源的：https://github.com/williamhatch/william_blog\n","id":"https://williamhatch.github.io/william_blog/blog/building-this-blog-with-ai-zh/","title":"我是如何搭建这个博客的：与Zola、GitHub和一个AI结对程序员的旅程"},"https://williamhatch.github.io/william_blog/blog/building-this-blog-with-ai/":{"body":"\n\"It is our job to create computing technology such that nobody has to program, and that the programming language is human. Everybody in the world is now a programmer. This is the miracle of AI.”\n\nThose are the words of NVIDIA's founder and CEO, Jensen Huang. He painted a future where creation is democratized, where the barrier between an idea and its digital form is dissolved by natural language. For many programmers, this sounded like a threat. For me, it sounded like an invitation.\nI wanted to build a personal blog. A space to share my thoughts, document my projects, and plant a flag in my own little corner of the internet. The \"how\" was a familiar path: I'd use Zola, a fast static site generator I'd been meaning to try, and deploy it for free on GitHub Pages. But I decided to add a twist. I wouldn't do it alone. I would do it almost entirely with an AI pair programmer, Cursor, to see just how close we are to Huang's vision.\nThis post is the story of that journey. It's not a sanitized, step-by-step tutorial where everything works perfectly. It's a real, raw account of the collaboration between man and machine. It's a story of triumph, of unexpected detours, of debugging hell, and ultimately, of a new, powerful way to build software.\nChapter 1: Laying the Foundation🔗\nEvery project starts with a single command. For me, it was zola init william_blog. But from that point on, I wanted the AI to take the lead.\nMe: \"Okay, I've started a Zola project. I want to build a simple blog and deploy it to GitHub Pages. Can you set up a basic structure and a GitHub Actions workflow for me?\"\nCursor (The AI): \"Of course.\"\nIt immediately scaffolded the project. It created a .gitignore file tailored for Zola projects. Then, it wrote the first version of our CI/CD pipeline in .github/workflows/gh-pages.yml. The idea was simple: on every push to the main branch, the action would build the Zola site and deploy the resulting static files to a gh-pages branch.\nThis was the AI's first test. It chose an action, getzola/zola-action-build, which seemed reasonable. It also proposed a basic theme, deepthought. I accepted, and it added it as a Git submodule.\nWith a skeleton in place, it was time for our first commit. And our first problem.\ngit commit -m \"Initial commit with basic structure and theme\"\nThe command failed. Git complained about the themes/deepthought directory being an uninitialized Git repository. It was a classic submodule snag. I told the AI what happened.\nCursor: \"I see. The submodule was added, but its own .git directory is causing a conflict. I will remove the submodule's Git metadata to treat it as a regular directory.\"\nIt executed rm -rf themes/deepthought/.git. The next commit worked flawlessly. We were on our way. I created a new repository on GitHub, and we pushed the code. The first Action started running.\nChapter 2: The Dance of Deployment🔗\nI watched the little yellow dot next to my commit on GitHub. It spun, then turned red. Failed.\nThis is where the partnership truly began. I wasn't just giving instructions; I was providing feedback on failure. I clicked into the logs, a wall of text that even seasoned developers dread. The error was cryptic: action not found.\nI fed this error back to the AI.\nMe: \"The GitHub Action failed. The error is action not found.\"\nCursor: \"I am searching for information on this error. It seems the getzola/zola-action-build action is deprecated. A more modern and maintained alternative is shalzz/zola-deploy-action. I will update the workflow file.\"\nWith a few keystrokes, it rewrote the gh-pages.yml file, replacing the old action with the new one, configuring the necessary inputs like the branch to deploy to. I committed and pushed again.\nThis time, the dot turned green. Success!\nI eagerly typed my new blog's URL into the browser: https://williamhatch.github.io/william_blog/.\nAnd was greeted by a stark white page with a single, soul-crushing message: 404 Not Found.\nThe deployment had succeeded, but the page wasn't there. This is a classic GitHub Pages puzzle. I explained the situation to the AI.\nCursor: \"A successful deployment with a 404 error on GitHub Pages often points to an issue with the repository's settings. Please ensure the source for GitHub Pages is set to 'Deploy from a branch' and the selected branch is gh-pages.\"\nI followed its instructions, navigating through the repository settings. It was exactly as the AI predicted. The source was still set to the default, waiting for me to tell it where to find the static files. I switched it to the gh-pages branch, saved, and refreshed the page.\nIt worked. A basic, unstyled page with \"Hello, World\" appeared. We were live.\nChapter 3: A Change of Scenery🔗\nThe deepthought theme was functional, but I quickly realized it was old and unmaintained. I wanted something more modern, with more features out of the box. After a bit of searching, I settled on zolarwind.\nThis meant a significant change. I didn't just want to swap files; I wanted to do it properly.\nMe: \"I've decided to switch themes. Let's remove deepthought and add zolarwind as a proper Git submodule. Then, to avoid any conflicts, let's delete all the templates and content we created and start fresh with the new theme's structure.\"\nThis \"scorched earth\" approach was a calculated risk. It would be faster than trying to merge two different theme structures. The AI understood immediately. It removed the old theme files, executed git submodule add https://github.com/huhu/zolarwind.git themes/zolarwind, and then proceeded to delete the templates, content, and other directories we had created, knowing they would be inherited from the new theme.\nChapter 4: The Custom Homepage🔗\nWith the new theme in place, it was time to make it my own. I didn't want the standard list of blog posts on the homepage. I wanted a personal introduction.\nI provided the AI with my bio and a list of my skills. I had a vision: a clean, professional header with a short bio, followed by a grid of my technical skills. I wanted a little flair, so I asked for a subtle animation where the skill cards would light up or grow when you hovered over them.\nCursor: \"I will create a custom index.html in the root templates directory to override the theme's default. I'll use Tailwind CSS for styling and implement the hover animations as requested.\"\nThis was the most creative task yet, and it handled it beautifully. It wrote the HTML structure, crafted the CSS classes for the layout, and added the necessary transform and transition properties for the hover effect. It even created a placeholder blog post so we'd have something to link to.\nChapter 5: The Localhost Labyrinth🔗\nThe custom homepage was done. The new theme was in place. I was excited to see it all come together. I ran the command I'd been waiting for: zola serve.\nAnd I entered what I can only describe as debugging hell.\nError: Template 'index.html' not found\nThis was bizarre. The file was right there. I told the AI.\nCursor: \"This is strange. Since you are using a theme, you might need to specify it in the command. Try zola serve --theme zolarwind.\"\nError: Found argument '--theme' which wasn't expected\nWhat? I checked my Zola version: v0.20.0. According to the documentation, this flag should exist. We were both stumped. We tried other flags, like --root .. Same error. We checked for shell aliases, for a corrupted Homebrew installation. Nothing made sense. It felt like my local environment was haunted.\nAfter a dozen failed attempts to fix the command, we pivoted. If the environment wouldn't bend, we would bend the project to its will.\nCursor: \"It seems your local Zola installation is behaving unexpectedly. I propose an alternative: we can copy all the necessary files from the zolarwind theme (templates, static, i18n, etc.) directly into your project's root directory. Then, we can comment out the theme setting in config.toml. This will make Zola see it as a single, self-contained project, bypassing the theme loading mechanism entirely.\"\nIt was a hack, but a brilliant one. A pragmatic solution to an illogical problem. The AI performed the copy, modified the config, and I ran zola serve one more time.\nIt worked. The local server spun up. But my relief was short-lived. The console was now flooded with a new wave of errors.\nChapter 6: A Cascade of Configuration Errors🔗\nOur hack had solved one problem but created a chain reaction of others. The zolarwind theme, now acting as the core of our project, had specific expectations for the config.toml file that our basic setup didn't meet.\nFirst, an error about a missing tags taxonomy. The AI added it.\n\nNext, a syntax error. The AI had initially put the taxonomy in a [taxonomies] table, but the theme expected a top-level key. It corrected itself. Then came errors about missing theme-specific variables like path_language_resources and incorrect data structures for menus and social links.\nFor nearly an hour, we went back and forth. I would run zola serve, paste the error, and the AI would analyze it, consult the theme's documentation, and propose a fix for config.toml. It was a tedious, painstaking process that would have been incredibly frustrating to do alone. But with the AI, it was a rapid, iterative loop: run, fail, report, fix, repeat.\nFinally, the stream of red text stopped. The server was running, error-free. I opened my browser to 127.0.0.1:1111 and there it was. My custom homepage, the new theme, everything working together. It was beautiful.\nChapter 7: The Final Boss🔗\nWith local development finally sorted, I pushed all our changes. The GitHub Action ran successfully. The green checkmark appeared. This was it.\nI navigated to https://williamhatch.github.io/william_blog/.\nThe page loaded. The HTML content was there. My bio, my skills, the blog post title. But all the styling was gone. The JavaScript was broken. The images were missing. It was a barren, unstyled mess.\nI opened the developer console. It was a sea of 404s. The browser was trying to load https://williamhatch.github.io/css/style.css, but it should have been looking for https://williamhatch.github.io/william_blog/css/style.css.\nThe repository subpath, /william_blog/, was missing from every single asset URL.\nThis was a problem my AI partner couldn't see, because it only existed in the context of GitHub Pages deployment. It was up to me to diagnose it. I used curl to confirm my suspicion. The problem was clear: the theme's templates were using hardcoded root-relative paths (e.g., href=\"/css/style.css\").\nI explained my findings to the AI. This was our final boss.\nMe: \"I've found the issue. The production site is broken because all the asset links in the templates are hardcoded with a leading slash, like /css/main.css. This doesn't work when the site is served from a subdirectory. We need to replace all of them with Zola's get_url() function to generate correct, absolute paths.\"\nCursor: \"I understand completely. I will perform a systematic search and replace across all relevant template files (base.html, header.html, list-element.html, etc.) to wrap every asset URL in get_url().\"\nAnd it did. It meticulously went through every template file, finding every &lt;link&gt;, &lt;script&gt;, and &lt;img&gt; tag. It replaced href=\"/css/generated.css\" with href=\"{{ get_url(path='css/generated.css') | safe }}\". It found paths hidden in partials and even within inline style attributes.\nI pushed the final set of changes. The Action ran. I held my breath and refreshed the page.\nAnd there it was. Perfect. The styles loaded, the hover animations worked, the images appeared. My blog was alive, fully functional, and deployed on the internet for all to see.\nConclusion: A New Dialogue🔗\nLooking back, was Jensen Huang right? Did I, a programmer, become obsolete? No. But the nature of my work changed. It became less about the monotonous, line-by-line grind of writing code and more about high-level direction, creative problem-solving, and precise debugging.\nThe journey was a dialogue.\n\nI said: \"Build me a blog.\"\nThe AI said: \"Here is a structure. Uh oh, it failed.\"\nI said: \"Here's the error. What does it mean?\"\nThe AI said: \"I've researched it. Here is the fix.\"\n\nThis partnership allowed me to operate at a higher level of abstraction. I was the architect, and the AI was the incredibly fast, knowledgeable, and tireless construction crew. It handled the boilerplate, researched obscure errors, and performed tedious refactoring, freeing me up to focus on the bigger picture.\nWe are not at a point where you can just say \"build me a billion-dollar app\" and have it appear. But we are at a point where the conversation between human and machine can create complex, functional, and beautiful software. The language is still punctuated by code, commits, and error logs, but the grammar is becoming more and more human. And that truly is a miracle.\nYou can visit the finished blog here: https://williamhatch.github.io/william_blog/\nAnd if you're curious to see the entire commit history of our journey, the code is open-source on GitHub: https://github.com/williamhatch/william_blog\n","id":"https://williamhatch.github.io/william_blog/blog/building-this-blog-with-ai/","title":"How I Built This Blog: A Journey with Zola, GitHub, and an AI Pair Programmer"},"https://williamhatch.github.io/william_blog/blog/convention-over-configuration-architecture-part1-zh/":{"body":"约定优于配置：从资深架构师视角解读现代软件设计🔗\n\n1. 为什么我们需要 CoC？从配置驱动到架构哲学🔗\n早期的 Java EE 时代，企业开发者需要大量手工编写 XML 来描述系统结构：\n\n重复声明：每个 bean、controller、service 都需手动配置\n关注点错位：配置逻辑和实现逻辑分离\n学习曲线陡峭：理解项目等于解析配置文件森林\n\n如果 90% 的项目结构类似，为什么不直接通过结构约定自动生成？这正是 CoC 的初衷。\n2. CoC 的定义与核心理念🔗\n\n“不要为框架能够推断的内容写配置。” —— DHH（Rails 之父）\n\n核心思想：\n\n提供合理的默认行为\n通过命名与目录结构约定完成自动配置\n只需对“例外情况”进行显式配置\n\n3. 主流框架中的 CoC 实现🔗\n框架CoC 展现形式常用工具\nRails基于目录结构自动加载rails generate scaffold\nSpring Boot注解 + Classpath 自动装配@ComponentScan 等\nDjangoApp 模块化 + 命名约定startapp, urls.py\nLaravel控制器 + 路由资源化artisan make:controller\nNestJS装饰器 + 模块结构@Controller, @Module()\n\n这些框架都在通过“结构约定”统一开发体验，使开发者关注业务逻辑。\n4. 从框架技巧到工程哲学🔗\nCoC 并不是语法糖，而是工程抽象的重要体现。\n\n统一代码风格：避免无意义的自由\n降低认知负担：减少重复选择\n提升协作效率：新成员快速理解项目结构\n易于迁移与演进：架构升级更可控\n\n5. 架构图与流程图🔗\n\n此图展示了现代框架如何整合：\n\n默认行为\n文件结构\n命名规范\n模块注入方式\n\n...统一为一体的约定式架构系统。\n6. CoC 在 DevOps 与微服务中的作用🔗\nDevOps 工具也普遍使用约定：\n\nTerraform：变量命名规范、文件分层\nKubernetes：YAML 结构、标签匹配、资源命名\nCI/CD：如 .github/workflows/、Jenkinsfile 的默认路径\n\nCoC 是 DevOps 能够扩展与模块化的基础。\n7. 代码迁移的桥梁：技术是可以迁移的🔗\n一旦掌握 CoC 架构方式，从 Rails 到 NestJS、Laravel 并不难。示例：\n\n\n\n✨ 结构、命名、路由方式完全一致。掌握一套结构模型，语言只是工具。\n8. AI、自动化与 CoC 的新演化🔗\n即使在 AI 工程与 MLOps 中：\n\n文件结构约定：data/, model/, train.py, inference.py\n工具约定：MLflow, Kubeflow 等都依赖默认路径\nPrompt 编程：模型根据结构提示生成代码\n\n结构决定生成结果，CoC 在 AI 编程中价值更大。\n9. 总结：CoC 是现代架构的通用语言🔗\nCoC 已成为：\n\n软件工程师的共同认知\n架构设计的基础规则\n多语言迁移的桥梁\n软件自动化与团队协作的核心\n\n\n“约定是送给团队未来成员的一份礼物。”\n\n\n作者：资深架构师 / 平台工程专家\n","id":"https://williamhatch.github.io/william_blog/blog/convention-over-configuration-architecture-part1-zh/","title":"约定优于配置：从资深架构师视角解读现代软件设计"},"https://williamhatch.github.io/william_blog/blog/convention-over-configuration-architecture-part1/":{"body":"Convention over Configuration: A Senior Architect’s Perspective on Modern Software Design🔗\n\n1. Why We Need CoC: The Pain of Early Configuration-Driven Systems🔗\nIn the early Java EE days, enterprise developers spent countless hours writing XML just to describe what the application should already know...\n\nOver-declaration: every bean, service, and controller had to be manually wired.\nSeparation of concerns gone wrong: configuration scattered outside implementation.\nCognitive overhead: understanding the system meant parsing endless files.\n\nIf 90% of projects follow a similar structure, why not standardize it?\nThis is the exact problem CoC solves.\n2. What Is Convention over Configuration?🔗\n\n“Don’t write configuration for things the framework can figure out.” — DHH, creator of Ruby on Rails\n\nThe idea is simple:\n\nPrefer sensible defaults over explicit setup.\nEncourage implicit structure through file naming and organization.\nLet developers focus on what’s different, not on repeating boilerplate.\n\n3. CoC Across Languages and Frameworks🔗\nFrameworkCoC in ActionTooling\nRailsFolder-based MVC, no route configrails generate scaffold\nSpring BootAutowiring, annotations over XML@ComponentScan etc.\nDjangoApp naming, admin auto discoverystartapp, urls.py\nLaravelController + Resource Route bindingsartisan make:controller\nNestJSModule structure + Decorator syntax@Controller, @Module()\n\nThese frameworks adopt the same mental model — directory structure, naming rules, default lifecycles.\n4. CoC as an Engineering Doctrine🔗\nCoC is not just a DX (Developer Experience) trick — it’s an engineering design strategy.\nGood architecture is invisible.\nIt guides teams without needing to be constantly enforced. CoC helps in:\n\nCode consistency across teams\nReduced onboarding time\nMinimized error surface\nAutomated tooling compatibility\n\n5. Architecture Visualization🔗\n\nThis diagram illustrates how modern frameworks integrate:\n\nScaffolding\nDefault behaviors\nNaming conventions\nDirectory layout\n\n...into a unified, opinionated software system.\n6. CoC in DevOps and Microservices🔗\nConvention-driven tools like:\n\nTerraform: Directory layout &amp; variable naming\nKubernetes YAML: Label selectors, config maps\nCI/CD: .github/workflows/, Jenkinsfile, etc.\n\nAll rely on shared conventions. As environments scale, conventions become guardrails.\n7. Code Portability Enabled by CoC🔗\nOnce you understand Rails, you’ll pick up Laravel or NestJS quickly — because CoC abstracts language differences.\n\n\n\n8. AI, Automation &amp; Future of CoC🔗\nEven modern AI workflows adopt CoC:\n\ndata/, model/, train.py, inference.py — this is a de facto convention\nMLflow and Kubeflow pipelines follow predictable directory and module conventions\nPrompt-based coding (Copilot / GPT) relies heavily on knowing the structure\n\nThis shows CoC is not obsolete — it is evolving.\n9. Final Thoughts🔗\nCoC is not a limitation — it’s a productivity enabler.\n\nIt minimizes choices that don’t matter.\nIt promotes clarity, collaboration, and growth.\nIt enables rapid transfer of skills across ecosystems.\n\n\n\"Conventions are a gift to your future team.\"\n\n\nWritten by a Senior Software Architect &amp; Platform Engineer\n","id":"https://williamhatch.github.io/william_blog/blog/convention-over-configuration-architecture-part1/","title":"Convention over Configuration: A Senior Architect’s Perspective on Modern Software Design"},"https://williamhatch.github.io/william_blog/blog/my-journey-in-tech/":{"body":"My journey in tech began with a strong foundation in mathematics, which I've leveraged to solve complex problems across various industries, from fintech and SaaS to automotive and digital consultancy.
